🚀 Personal 3D Portfolio Website

This project is a fully–custom 3D interactive portfolio website that I designed and developed to push the boundaries of modern web experiences. It combines immersive Three.js elements, smooth animations, and a clean UI to create a visually engaging and highly responsive portfolio.

Throughout this build, I gained hands-on experience with advanced 3D libraries, real-time rendering, animation workflows, and scalable React architecture. The project serves as a showcase of both creativity and technical depth—perfect for developers looking to explore the next level of front-end engineering.
